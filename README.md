The week saw us looking into writing and analysing with SQL. We used the SQL language to clean the datasets we used.
We also used the SQL language to analyse the data for our insights.

## Data

The data came from www.kaggle.com

## Tools Used

We again used the www.skillable.com platform for the online labs to get our feel for the platform.
